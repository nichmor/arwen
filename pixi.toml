# build x64 versions
# building x32 versions is not supported on macOS after Xcode 9.4/9.4.1
# so most probably you will not be able to build x32 versions on your new macOS.
# to overcome this, we ship some x32 versions of different binaries nearby the x64 ones.
# If you think you are able to build x32 versions, just use -m32 instead of -m64.
